# File locations

## Config file

The config file is `config.toml`.  It is located according to the [Blender standard](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/advanced/blender_directory_layout.html).

On the Mac it is 

`~/Library/Application\ Support/Blender/4.3/config/xtrkcad/`

The same config file is used for the items that run outside of blender.

Currently this is linked (with ln) to the file in the data folder under to project folder.

## Edit the xtc file with VS Code
